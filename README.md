## Overview
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks play a crucial role in modern distributed systems. However, their decentralized nature introduces significant security challenges. Traditional signature-based systems often fail to catch zero-day threats or evolving malicious patterns.

This project presents an **Intelligent P2P Network Traffic Anomaly Detection System** that leverages machine learning to analyze flow-level network traffic. Instead of relying on predefined rules, the system learns the statistical "fingerprint" of normal traffic and identifies deviations that indicate malware, unauthorized access, or abnormal P2P behavior.

---

## Objectives
* **Behavioral Detection:** Identify anomalies using ML rather than static signatures.
* **Flow-Level Analysis:** Analyze traffic via packet rates, durations, and resource usage.
* **Accessibility:** Provide a web-based interface for both single-record and batch (CSV) predictions.
* **Scalability:** Offer a modular framework that supports multiple ML algorithms.

---

## Key Features
* **Multi-Model Support:** Choose between KNN, SVC, and Naive Bayes.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Automated feature scaling and handling of class imbalance using **SMOTE**.
* **Dual-Level Classification:**
    1.  **Traffic Anomaly:** (Normal vs. Anomalous)
    2.  **Risk Severity:** Predicting the threat level of authentication behavior.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Real-time performance metrics and results via a Flask web UI.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline to ensure data integrity and model accuracy:



1.  **Data Ingestion:** Loads CSV datasets or accepts manual user input.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Feature extraction, `StandardScaler` application, and validation.
3.  **Model Layer:** Handles training, saving, and loading of `.pkl` files.
4.  **Analysis Engine:** Executes classification and risk assessment.
5.  **Web Interface:** Renders results and evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall).

## Machine Learning Models Used

| Model | Use Case | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Local Anomaly Detection | Excellent at finding clusters of malicious activity. |
| **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** | Complex Traffic Patterns | Uses RBF kernels for non-linear decision boundaries. |
| **Naive Bayes** | Baseline Comparison | Fast, efficient, and requires minimal computational resources. |

## Dataset Description

The system utilizes flow-level statistics rather than raw packet inspection, focusing on features such as:

* **Transmission Metrics:** Packet size, flow duration, and latency.
* **System Metrics:** CPU usage, memory usage, and active connections.
* **Security Logs:** Firewall blocks, IDS alerts, and authentication failures.
